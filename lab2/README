Lab 2 Goal:
The goal of the second assignment is to create a PostgreSQL data schema with 4 tables that are very similar to the tables that you created in Lab1. The tables have the same names, attributes and data types as the tables of Lab1, and the same primary keys but there are some UNIQUE constraints and some restrictions on NULLs.
After you create the data schema with the 4 tables, you will be required to write some SQL statements that use those tables. You have been given data that you can load into your tables so that you can test the results of your queries. Testing can prove that a query is wrong, but not that it is right, so be careful. Lab2 is due in two weeks, so you will have an opportunity to discuss the assignment during the Discussion Section in the first week of the assignment, and to discuss issues you have had in writing a solution to the assignment during the Discussion Section of the second week. Instructions for submitting the assignment appear at the end of this document.
